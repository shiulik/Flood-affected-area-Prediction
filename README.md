# Flood-Affected Area Prediction

**Project Introduction:**

*This project aims to predict flood-affected areas using machine learning techniques. The dataset comprises various features related to flood conditions, such as duration, source bytes, and other relevant metrics. By preprocessing and analyzing this data, the goal is to build an accurate predictive model that can help in identifying flood-prone areas, thereby aiding in disaster management and response efforts.*

**Loaded Libraries and Data:**

* Imported essential libraries like numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.
* Loaded the dataset from the Kaggle input directory.

**Explored the Data:**

* Displayed the first few rows and checked the data types and info.
* Created a heatmap to check for missing values (none found).
* Described the data to identify potential outliers in specific columns.

**Data Preprocessing:**

* Used Label Encoding to convert categorical columns (protocoltype, service, flag) into numerical format.
* Dropped the original categorical columns after encoding.
* Combined the processed features with the target column.

**Visualized the Data:**

* Created visualizations for each column to understand the data distribution better.

**Conclusion:**

*Through careful data exploration, preprocessing, and visualization, the dataset was thoroughly prepared for model building. The next steps involve training a machine learning model to predict flood-affected areas accurately. This project has the potential to significantly contribute to disaster management efforts by providing timely and accurate predictions.*
